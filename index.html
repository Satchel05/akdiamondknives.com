          I’m a young, amature knifemaker who has over a year of experience, and
          over 20 knives made. Making knives is one of my favorite things to do
          and I am thankful that I have the time and resources to do it. I am
          self taught, and I am still learning how to improve and expand into
          new techniques. Making knives is not my job, but it’s a hobby I am
          very passionate about. Because of that, I don’t really charge anything
          for the time I spend. When I make knives I try to stay focused on all
          of the details so that I can produce something both functional and
          beautiful. I strongly value customer satisfaction; it feels
          uncomfortable on a personal level for me to know that a customer isn’t
          100% satisfied with their knife. I am happy to give refunds and/or
          receive your feedback.

          Bushcraft, hunting, general outdoors knives: This is the type of knife
          I have most experience with. I can make a variety of shapes and sizes
          of this type of knife. I also make edc knives, that are generally for
          lighter use than the above knives. Some people have a specific shape
          they want, which I also make. Add pic 14 as well. I recently made my
          first chef knife and would love to make more. I can also make smaller
          paring knives. I can’t make knives that have blades more than 8.5
          inches long. Also I can’t make knives that are wider than 2 inches and
          knives that are wider than 1.5 inches will cost more. I only work with
          flat stock, so I can’t make icepick/tri-dagger style knives. Also, I
          can’t make blades with a concave curve in the blade (for example a
          karambit). Lastly, all of my knives are full tang. Blade Finishes
          Currently I only do hand sanded finishes and vinegar etching. A mirror
          finish will cost a little more and take longer. If you want acid and
          stone washing please let me know because I am considering buying the
          necessary equipment. I currently don’t have it so it may take longer
          if you are the first customer to ask for it. The picture below is a
          knife with a vinegar etch, the rest of my knives on this site are not
          etched. I have a neighbor who makes custom molded kydex sheaths. They
          cost 15$, but possibly more for special things like belt clips. I can
          also have him make sheaths for knives that you may own, but they would
          have to be shipped to me and back which would add to the price.

          I make my knives to order. If you want a knife, email me at
          akdiamondknives@gmail.com. This website is just for information, I
          handle most things through my email. You can email me a picture of a
          knife you want made, or just describe what you want. Next, I will send
          you a sketch of the knife, and we can tweak it so that you get exactly
          what you want. I will also ask about what type of blade finish, handle
          material, etc you want. I take my payment through Paypal after I have
          finished and will notify you first if there are any small issues with
          the knife. In the past some of my knives have had very slight warping
          or a few scratches, and I prefer to mention it before shipping things
          off. I also want to mention that as far as I know my customers were
          all satisfied with their knives and most sent back emails saying that
          they really liked them. I mostly make knives one at a time and I keep
          a list of people in the order that they asked for a knife. If you
          change your mind about anting a knife that's fine just let me know.

          My base price is $50 with shipping included. If you want a longer
          knife, a more time consuming finish, or a knife made with materials I
          don’t have it may cost more. Other things may also affect the price. I
          will tell you the price before I start on the knife. If you are not
          satisfied, I will offer a refund for all but $10 (provided you send
          the knife back). If the knife breaks and you think it’s my fault, let
          me know and I may fix it or give you a refund. This isn’t an official
          warranty, but I would feel bad about selling a knife that doesn’t work
          properly; and I want to make things right.

          I can also restore and fix broken knives. Even if they are not broken
          I can put a new handle on a knife that has a full tang. If they are
          expensive or irreplaceable I don’t want to work on them because there
          is a possibility I could damage or break them. Below is a picture of a
          sword that I restored. Sword pics (11 and 12 here) I can also make
          custom knife blanks and knife making kits. Depending on what exactly
          you want, they will be in the 30$-45$ range, plus shipping. If you
          have any questions about knives or knife maintenance email me. I’ll do
          my best to answer your questions or direct you to more info. I enjoy
          talking about knives so this is completely free. Also if you are
          interested in getting into knife making feel free to reach out. I can
          give advice on how to start out cheaply and not make certain beginner
          mistakes.
