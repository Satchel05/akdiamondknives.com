          Hello, I’m a young, amature knifemaker who has over a year of
          experience, and over 20 knives made. Making knives is one of my
          favorite things to do and I am thankful that I have the time and
          resources to do it. When I make knives I try to stay focused on all of
          the details so that I can produce something both functional and
          beautiful. I strongly value customer satisfaction; it feels
          uncomfortable on a personal level for me to know that a customer isn’t
          100% satisfied with their knife. I am happy to give refunds and/or
          receive your feedback. NOTE: the top knife is what the knives I sell
          look like, the bottom ones are ones that I have kept and abused.
        </p>

          The type of knives I have the most experience with are bushcraft,
          hunting, and general outdoors knives. I am able to makea variety of
          shapes and sizes of this type of knife. I also make Kitchen Knives,
          Paring Knives, and EDC knives that are generally for lighter use.
          <br /><br />
          I can’t make knives that have blades more than 8.5 inches long or
          knives that are wider than 2 inches.
          <br /><br />
          All of my knives are full tang, and I currently only have 1095 steel.
          Currently I only do hand sanded finishes and vinegar etching. A mirror
          finish will cost a little more and take longer. If you want acid and
          stone washing please let me know. I have a neighbor who makes custom
          molded kydex sheaths. They cost $15, but possibly more for special
          things like belt clips. I can also have him make sheaths for knives
          that you may own, but they would have to be shipped to me and back
          which would add to the price.

        <p>
          My base price is $50 with shipping included. If you want a longer
          knife, a more time consuming finish, or a knife made with materials I
          don’t have it may cost more. If you are not satisfied, I will offer a
          refund for all but $10 (provided you send the knife back). If the
          knife breaks and you think it’s my fault, let me know and I may fix it
          or give you a refund.
          <br /><br />
          STEP 1: You can email me a picture of a knife you want made (or just
          describe what you want) at akdiamondknives@gmail.com.
          <br /><br />
          STEP 2: I will send you a sketch of the knife, and we can tweak it so
          that you get exactly what you want. I will also ask about what type of
          blade finish, handle material, etc you want.
          <br /><br />
          STEP 3: I take my payment through PayPal after I have finished and
          will notify you when it is ready or if there are any issues with the
          knife.

          I am able to restore and fix broken knives. Even if they are not
          broken I can put a new handle on a knife that has a full tang. If they
          are expensive or irreplaceable I don’t want to work on them because
          there is a possibility I could damage or break them. I can also make
          custom knife blanks and knife making kits which will be in the $30 -
          $45 range, plus shipping. If you have any questions about knives or
          knife maintenance email me. I’ll do my best to answer your questions
          or direct you to more info. I enjoy talking about knives so this is
          completely free. If you are interested in getting into knife making
          feel free to reach out. I can give advice on how to start out and not
          make certain beginner mistakes.
